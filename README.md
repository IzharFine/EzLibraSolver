# EzLibraSolver

Solution for algorithm, The question:<br/>
<br/>
You get input string contains only 'L' or 'R' chars,<br/>
You have weights count as the length of your string chars.<br/>
Each weight have weigh as her start index.<br/>
We have a libra, the libra can lean only to one side (left or right, can't be equal).<br/>
We need to put each time one weight on one side of the libra that the libra will lean to the side of the current char.<br/>
<br/>
### example:<br/>
If we'll get the string: "RRL" we'll get 3 weights (1,2,3).<br/>
We'll put the 2 weight on the right side, then the 1 weight to the right side and the 3 to the left side.
