# EzLibraSolver

Solution for algorithm.
The question:

You get input string contains only 'L' or 'R' chars,
You have weights count as the length of your string chars.
Each weight have weigh as her start index.
We have a libra, the libra can lean only to one side (left or right, can't be equal).
We need to put each time one weight on one side of the libra that the libra will lean to the side of the current char.

example:
If we'll get the string: "RRL" we'll get 3 weights (1,2,3)
We'll put the 2 weight on the right side, then the 1 weight to the right side and the 3 to the left side.
